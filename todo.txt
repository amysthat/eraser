v0.3 playtest (brother):
# BUG: you can "downgrade" your section
BUG: plane code is unstable
OVERSIGHT: player fails to understand that parrying a canon ball/plane aids them
OVERSIGHT: it's not clear how one sided tiles work
OVERSIGHT: there's not enough contrast to differ one sided tiles
BAD IMPLEMENTATION: parry logic doesn't always yield the same result
BAD GAME DESIGN: it's not clear where to go
BAD GAME DESIGN: the player knows too little, game becomes frustrating
BAD GAME DESIGN: the difficulty curve is way too intense, the game becomes hard and *bad*.
